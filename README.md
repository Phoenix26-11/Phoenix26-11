# Hi there 👋, I'm Aaradhy Shrivastava
I'm Aaradhya Shrivastava. I'm Indian by birth, and am currently living in the US since 2022. As of making this file, I am going into 10th grade. I love programming, and I love learning about new things. As of right now, I am learning C++, and I am also improving my JavaScript skills. I am also currently learning about Git and GitHub because I think it will help me in my career in the future. I currently know basic programming in Python, and I have learned basic OOP in Java. I will be taking AP CS A this year to get into a good college. I am currently aiming for MIT. I am also learning C++ to prepare for USACO, and I think USACO will be pretty fun, considering that I have never done competitive programming. Here's a link to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@phoenixcodez.
